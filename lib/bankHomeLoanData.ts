HDFC also offers a 0.05% interest concession for women borrowers and has a specialised product called HDFC Reach for customers with informal or irregular income documentation."

Axis also offers competitive balance transfer rates for borrowers looking to switch from higher-rate lenders. Note that Axis's processing fee of 1% is among the higher ones in the market — factor this into your total cost of borrowing."

The trade-off is processing time — PNB typically takes longer than private banks, and the digital application experience is less polished."
