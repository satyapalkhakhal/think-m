SBI offers from 8.75%, HDFC from 9.10%, ICICI from 9.10%, Axis from 9.15%, and Kotak from 9.25%. Used car loans are typically 1–2% higher than new car loans." }

Bank of Baroda also offers competitive rates from 8.80%. Rates vary based on credit score, employment type, loan amount, and vehicle category. Always compare the final on-road loan offer from multiple lenders." }

Some lenders like HDFC and ICICI offer up to 8 years for select models. Longer tenure means lower EMI but higher total interest paid. A 7-year loan on ₹10 lakh at 9.5% costs ₹4.73 lakh more in interest than a 5-year loan." }

          "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Most banks allow car loan prepayment after 6–12 EMIs. RBI guidelines prohibit foreclosure charges on floating rate loans. Fixed rate car loans may have a prepayment penalty of 2–5% of the outstanding amount. SBI, HDFC, and ICICI charge nil foreclosure on floating rate car loans. Always check your loan agreement for specific terms." }

          "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Most banks finance up to 85–90% of the car's on-road price, meaning a minimum down payment of 10–15% is required. For a ₹10 lakh car, you need ₹1–1.5 lakh as down payment. Some banks offer 100% financing for select models to existing customers with excellent credit. A higher down payment reduces your EMI and total interest." }

          "name": "Does a car loan affect my credit score?",
          "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Taking a car loan creates a hard inquiry which may temporarily lower your CIBIL score by 5–10 points. However, making all EMIs on time consistently improves your credit score over time. Missing even one EMI can reduce your score by 50–100 points and negatively impact future loan eligibility." }

However, if the vehicle is used for business purposes, you can claim the interest paid as a business expense under Section 37(1) of the Income Tax Act. Self-employed individuals and business owners can thus deduct car loan interest from their taxable income." }
