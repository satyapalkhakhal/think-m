                    { '@type': 'Question', name: 'What is a good CAGR?', acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'A good CAGR depends on the asset class. For equity, 12-15% is considered good. For debt, 7-9% is acceptable. Always compare CAGR against the relevant benchmark.' } },
                    { '@type': 'Question', name: 'Is CAGR same as returns?', acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'No. CAGR is the average compounded growth rate. Actual yearly returns may vary wildly. CAGR smooths them into a single number for easy comparison.' } },
                    { '@type': 'Question', name: 'Can CAGR be negative?', acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Yes, if your investment value decreased over time. A negative CAGR means your investment lost value on average each year.' } },
                    { '@type': 'Question', name: 'What is the Rule of 72?', acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Divide 72 by the CAGR to estimate how many years it takes to double your money. Example: At 12% CAGR, money doubles in ~6 years.' } },
                    { '@type': 'Question', name: "CAGR vs XIRR — what's the difference?", acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'CAGR assumes a lump sum investment. XIRR handles multiple cash flows (like SIPs) at irregular intervals. Use XIRR for SIP returns.' } },
                    { '@type': 'Question', name: 'Does CAGR account for inflation?', acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'No. CAGR shows nominal returns. To get real returns, subtract the inflation rate from CAGR. Example: 12% CAGR - 6% inflation = 6% real return.' } },
                    { '@type': 'Question', name: 'How to calculate CAGR for mutual funds?', acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Use NAV at start date as Initial Value and NAV at end date as Final Value. Apply the CAGR formula: (End/Start)^(1/years) - 1.' } },
                    { '@type': 'Question', name: 'Is higher CAGR always better?', acceptedAnswer: { '@type': 'Answer', text: 'Not necessarily. Higher CAGR often comes with higher risk. A 15% CAGR in small-caps has much higher risk than 8% CAGR in FDs. Consider risk-adjusted returns.' } },
